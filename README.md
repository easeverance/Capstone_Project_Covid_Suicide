# Question (and Resources)
* Why did the suicide rates during the lockdown of the pandemic (2020) decrease, but different demographic characteristics increased with different demographic characteristics (age, sex, and race). 
* Use machine learning with data to try and find a correlation

* Resources - resource_links_and_overall_question.docx - provides the articles and cites with discovering the question at hand, along with raw data tables.
