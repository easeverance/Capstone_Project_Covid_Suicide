# Capstone_Project_Covid_Pandemic Predictor

## Hypothesis - Theory
Covid 19 has proven to be one of the worlds deadliest viral pandemics since the Spanish Flu in 1918.  This project is looking to see specifically in the US what could be causing more infections/deaths in specific locations in the US verus other locations in the US.  
* What variables have a positive co-relation to Covid-19 infected areas. 
* Can we predict breakout areas and areas that are more vulnerable to future outbreaks
